## Syllabus

#### Week 1: Introduction to Processes

>"Are you someone who likes to see the big-picture? Being a forward thinker who knows what’s coming next is an invaluable trait as a software product manager. This module will prepare you to become this asset for your team. A software process organizes development from beginning to end. We are going to walk through each step of the development process. This will allow you to become familiar with the entire development process so that you can effectively organize product development and foresee upcoming steps--even if you’ve never worked in software development before!"

#### Week 2: Process Models

>"Ready to dive a little deeper? This module will familiarize you with a wide variety of software process models from throughout history. You will learn about basic software process models, like the Waterfall model and The Unified Process. These fundamental processes will set the stage for the knowledge you will gain later in the course, where more complex processes will be introduced."

#### Week 3: Agile Practices

>"Do you want to help developers reach their full potential? Do you want to impress clients by delivering a great product on-schedule and on-budget? Then this module is the place for you! In this module, you will learn some Agile methodologies that are practiced in the industry today. This module will cover the Scrum and Extreme Programming methodologies. The practices in these methodologies are some of the most popular practices in the industry today. They provide practices that will help to maintain organized and effective development. These methodologies will help you to know the exact state of your product and deliver successfully!"

#### Week 4: Other Practices

>"Almost there! In this last module, we will dive into Lean Software Development and Kanban. Being the most complex tools which we will cover in this course makes them the “spike-driving machines” from our railroad-building analogy. Lean and Kanban are a cumulation of many lessons learned, and are widely used in some form in the industry today."

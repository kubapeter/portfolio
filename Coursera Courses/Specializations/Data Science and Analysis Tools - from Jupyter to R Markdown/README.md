## Description of the specialization

>"This specialization is intended for people without programming experience who seek an approachable introduction to data science that uses Python and R to describe and visualize data sets. This course will equip learners with foundational knowledge of data analysis suitable for any analyst roles. In these four courses, you will cover everything from data wrangling to data visualization. These topics will help prepare you to handle various types of data sets, giving you enough knowledge of data science to proficiently compare data sets, describe their relationship, and produce visualizations that highlight that relationship."

## Remarks
- The philosophy of the whole specialization is learning by doing. There are no videos, all the concepts are taught by code examples, and coding puzzles. 
- A very well documented specialization. From its pdf documents one can really get a deep insight into the course.

**9 hours** to complete - 3 quizzes, 1 [coding assignment](./Final%20Project)

Course 2 of the [Introduction to Scripting in Python Specialization](../) 

---

## Course description

>"This course will continue the introduction to Python programming that started with Python Programming Essentials. We'll learn about different data representations, including strings, lists, and tuples, that form the core of all Python programs. We will also teach you how to access files, which will allow you to store and retrieve data within your programs. These concepts and skills will help you to manipulate data and write more complex Python programs.
>
>By the end of the course, you will be able to write Python programs that can manipulate data stored in files. This will extend your Python programming expertise, enabling you to write a wide range of scripts using Python"

[^1]: For ethical reasons I do not make my assignment publicly available. It may be tempting to submit it to Coursera by others. However, I give a detailed description of the original problem, I highlight the main principles and techniques the problem wants to check, and I give source code for another similar problem. The publicly available source code uses approximately the same principles and techniques as the original (maybe a bit more).

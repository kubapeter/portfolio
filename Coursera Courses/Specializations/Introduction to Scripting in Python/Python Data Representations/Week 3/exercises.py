# 1. 

# Given a list example_list containing at least 4 elements, write an expression that assigns the value 0 to the 
# third element of the list. 

# 2. 

# Given a list example_list containing at least 4 elements, write an expression that replaces the second and 
# third elements of the list by the list [0, 0, 0].

# 3. 

# Given a list example_list, write an expression that mutates example_list such that the number 0 is 
# appended (i.e. added to the end) to the list. 

# 4. 

# Given a list example_list, write an expression that mutates example_list such that the numbers in the 
# list [0, 0, 0] are appended to the list. You should not use a loop here. 

# 5. 

# Given a list example_list, write an expression that appends the numbers in the list [0, 0, 0] to 
# example_list. Note that this expression should not mutate example_list. (Again, you should not use a 
# loop here.) 

# 6. 

# Given a list example_list, write a loop that mutates example_list such that the numbers in the list 
# [0, 0, 0] are appended to the list. 

# 7. 

# Given a list example_list, write an expression that constructs a tuple whose items correspond to those in 
# example_list. 

# 8. 

# Given a list example_list, write an expression that mutates example_list by shuffling (i.e. randomly 
# reordering) the items in this list. Hint: investigate the various methods in the random module.

# 9. 

# Challenge: The items in a list can themselves be lists. These nested lists can be used to represent a wide range of 
# 2D data such as spreadsheet information. Write a function flatten(nested_list) that takes as input the 
# list of lists nested_list. The function flaten() should return a list consisting of the items in the sublists of 
# nested_list all appended together. (See the provided template for example input and output.)

# 10. 

# Challenge: Write a function remove_duplicates(items) that takes a list items and returns a new list 
# that consists of all unique items in items. The items in the returned list should be in the same order as those in 
# items.

In the academic world, 
plagiarism is a very serious offense. 
It can result in punishments 
such as a failing grade, 
the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution.
The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism 
may be tempered by the fact 
that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. 
There are studies showing that freshmen university students 
did not have a good understanding of even the basic requirements 
of how to attribute sources in written academic work, 
even though students were quite confident 
that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are. 
These same students also had a lenient view 
of how plagiarism should be penalised.

For cases of repeated plagiarism, 
or for cases in which a student commits serious plagiarism, 
suspension or expulsion may occur. 

Yet, to impose sanctions, plagiarism needs to be exposed. 
Strategies faculty members use to catch plagiarism include 
reading students work carefully
and making note of inconsistencies in student writing, 
citation errors and giving plagiarism prevention education to students.
It has been found that a large number of university lucturers 
do not use detection methods like text-matching software.
A few more try to catch plagiarism by reading term-papers 
specifically for plagiarism, 
while the latter method might not be very effective 
in detecting plagiarism.  
There are checklists of tactics to prevent student plagiarism.

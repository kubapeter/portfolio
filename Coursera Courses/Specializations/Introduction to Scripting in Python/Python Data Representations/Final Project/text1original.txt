In the academic world, 
plagiarism by students is usually considered a very serious offense 
that can result in punishments 
such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, 
the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution.[4] 
The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism 
may be tempered by a recognition 
that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. 
A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study 
did not have a good understanding of even the basic requirements 
of how to attribute sources in written academic work, 
yet students were very confident 
that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are.[62] 
The same students also had a lenient view 
of how plagiarism should be penalised.

For cases of repeated plagiarism, 
or for cases in which a student commits severe plagiarism 
(e.g., purchasing an assignment), suspension or expulsion may occur. 
There has been historic concern about inconsistencies 
in penalties administered for university student plagiarism, 
and a plagiarism tariff was devised in 2008 
for UK higher education institutions 
in an attempt to encourage some standardization of approaches.[63]

However, to impose sanctions, plagiarism needs to be detected. 
Strategies faculty members use to detect plagiarism include 
carefully reading students work 
and making note of inconsistencies in student writing, 
citation errors and providing plagiarism prevention education to students.[64] 
It has been found that a significant share of (university) teachers 
do not use detection methods such as using text-matching software.[65] 
A few more try to detect plagiarism by reading term-papers 
specifically for plagiarism, 
while the latter method might be not very effective 
in detecting plagiarism â€“ especially when plagiarism 
from unfamiliar sources needs to be detected.[65] 
There are checklists of tactics to prevent student plagiarism.

Given the serious consequences that plagiarism has for students, 
there has been a call for a greater emphasis on learning 
in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism.[67][68][69] 
This is especially important when students move to a new institution 
that may have a different view of the concept when compared with the view 
previously developed by the student.[67] 
Indeed, given the seriousness of plagiarism accusations for a student's future, 
the pedagogy of plagiarism education may need to be considered 
ahead of the pedagogy of the discipline being studied.[67] 
The need for plagiarism education extends to academic staff, 
who may not completely understand what is expected of their students 
or the consequences of misconduct.[70][64][71] 
Actions to reduce plagiarism include coordinating teaching activities 
to decrease student load; reducing memorization, increasing individual practical activities; 
and promoting positive reinforcement over punishment.[72][73][74]

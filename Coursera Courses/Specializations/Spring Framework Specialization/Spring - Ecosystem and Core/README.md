# Spring - Ecosystem and Core

Offered by 
### *LearnQuest*

Taught by: [Derek Parsons](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~82638970)

---

**12 hours** to complete - 3 quizzes, 6 [programming labs](./Labs)

Course 1 of the [Spring Framework Specialization](../) 

---

## Course description

>"In this course students will learn the why the Spring Framework is one of the dominant Java development Frameworks. the course covers a variety of techniques for Java Object Dependency Injection using various forms of configuration data i.e. XML, Annotations and Java Configuration Classes with Factory Methods. Configurations will be enhanced with Expression Languages  and Conditional Beans that are  available  based off certain conditions like development environment i.e. test and production. Students will build an extensive application iteratively in a succession of hands on labs."

## Syllabus

#### Module 1: What is Spring?

>"Identify the motivation for the Spring Framework in Enterprise Application Development, Implement a Spring Inversion of Control Container and use Dependency Injection techniques using XML meta-data configurations"
>- Explain what Spring Framework is and why developers use it
>- Understand the role of the major modules in Spring
>- Explain the key concepts of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection
>- Explain what Spring does for the programmer
>- Explain the purpose of loose Coupling between beans
>- Explain how the Spring Inversion of Control (IoC) Container Manages your Spring Beans
>- Explain what is an ApplicationContext and how do we create one?
>- Get a bean out of the Spring ApplicationContext and use it
>- Configure the `ApplicationContext` with Bean Definitions
>- Define Setter injection in an XML configuration file
>- Define Constructor Injection in an XML configuration file
>- Get a Spring Managed Bean and its object graph out of the Application Context

#### Module 2: Annotations and Java Config

>"Achieve Spring ApplicationContext configuration using Spring and Javax Annotations and Java Configuration Classes"
>- Achieve Dependency Injection using Spring Annotations
>- Use Spring Annotations to wire up dependencies in Spring Managed Beans
>- Use javax JSR-250, and JSR330 Annotations to wire up dependencies in Spring Managed Beans
>- Create Java `@Configuration` Classes
>- Remove the dependency on XML configuration files completely
>- Write JUnit Test classes that are part of the ApplicationContext

#### Module 3: Externalize Configuration

>"Utilize Expressions in Spring Configurations by either Expression Language for literal injection or Spring Expression Language (SPEL) for a more dynamic installation. Provide Conditionals for selective inclusion of beans in a configuration."
>- Use property files for configuration data and use it for Expressions used with `@Value`
>- Define Spring Provided Managed Beans
>- Use Spring Expression Language (SPEL) for power expressions used with `@Value`
>- Understand the need for Conditional beans in development
>- Use Pre defined Conditionals from Spring Boot in your applications

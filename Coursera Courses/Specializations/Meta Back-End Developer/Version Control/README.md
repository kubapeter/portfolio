## Syllabus

#### [Week 1](./Week%201): Software collaboration

> In this module, you will learn about how modern software developers collaborate across the world without messing up each other's code. This involves using version control or subversion to bring order to the chaos of massive software projects that have the potential for mistakes and bugs. You will look at the different version control systems and how to create an effective software development workflow.

#### [Week 2](./Week%202): Command Line

> In this module you will learn how to use the command line to execute commands in Linux. You will be introduced to some of most commonly used commands that traverse, create, rename, and delete files on your hard drive. You will learn how easy it is to use piping and redirection to create powerful workflows that will automate your work, saving you time and effort.

#### [Week 3](./Week%203): Working with Git

> This module will help you to develop a strong conceptual understanding of the Git technology and how it is used in software development projects to manage team files. You will install Git, create a local repository, create a commit, create a remote repository and push commits to a remote repository.

#### [Week 4](./Week%204): Graded Assessment

> In this module, you will be assessed on the key skills covered in the Course.

[^1]: For ethical reasons I do not share my assignments. It is strictly against [Coursera Honor Code](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code?language=en_US). However, for every assignment I give a detailed description of the original problem, I highlight the main principles and techniques the problem wants to check, and I share the source code of another similar problem. The publicly available source code uses approximately the same principles and techniques as the original (sometimes a bit more).

# Week 1 <br> Getting started with Python

## Learning Objectives
- Recognize common applications of the Python programming language.
- Explain foundational software engineering concepts.
- Use operators to program a simple output in Python.
- Use control flow and loops to solve a problem

## Subjects covered
- code blocks and indentation, line break `\`
- commenting `#`
- variables, data types: numeric (integer, float, complex), sequence (string, [list], (tuples) ), {dictionary}, boolean, {set}
- `type`, `anystring[i]`, `len()`, `def`
- type casting, implicit and explicit conversion, `str()`, `int()`, `float()`
- `input()`, `print()`, direct formatting `'formatted string {} has {} and {}'.format(name, a, b)`
- math operators: `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`; logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- control flow: `if`, `else`, `elif`, `match`, `while`
  - `for char in string:`, `for variable in sequence:`, `range(n)`, nested loops

## Assignments

There is one assignment for week 1. 

#### [Type casting input](./typecast.py)

> "In this lab you will be presented with three exercises to demonstrate how explicit type casting can be used to solve data being inputted from an end user. Each exercise will ask you to solve a particular problem relating to types.
> 
> Goal: To understand how and where to use implicit casting.
> 
> Objectives
>- Exercise 1: Use explicit casting to apply the correct cast type
>- Exercise 2: Fix the script so it correctly outputs the bill total

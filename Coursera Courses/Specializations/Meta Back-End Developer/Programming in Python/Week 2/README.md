## Assignments[^1]

[^1]: Please note that the codes I share here are not the codes submitted in the course for it would be against the [Coursera Honor Code](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code?language=en_US). I solve a similar problems with similar techniques, so they cannot be submitted, but they cover roughly the same scope of knowledge. 

There are two assignments for week 2. 

#### [Functions, loops and data structures](./typecast.py)

> "In this lab you will be presented with a menu ordering system which will allow users to input three choices for a select menu. You are tasked with completing the menu system so that it returns and calculates the final bill for the user.
> 
> Objectives
>- Create new functions to solve specific problems.
>- Gain experience of using for loops to iterate over different data collections.
>- Create and use data structures to store, retrieve and loop over data.

#### [Read in data, store, manipulate and output new data to a file](./typecast.py)

> "In this lab you must read the contents of a file and then write the contents to another file. You must also store the contents of a file into a list so that it can be accessed in different ways. 
> 
> Goal: Use the open function for reading and writing files.
> 
> Objectives
>- Create a function for reading in a file.
>- Create a function for writing files.

## Assignments[^1]

[^1]: Please note that the codes I share here are not the codes submitted in the course for it would be against the [Coursera Honor Code](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code?language=en_US). I solve a similar problems with similar techniques, so they cannot be submitted, but they cover roughly the same scope of knowledge. 

There is one assignment for week 1. 

#### [Type casting input](./typecast.py)

> "In this lab you will be presented with three exercises to demonstrate how explicit type casting can be used to solve data being inputted from an end user. Each exercise will ask you to solve a particular problem relating to types.
> 
> Goal: To understand how and where to use implicit casting.
> 
> Objectives
>- Exercise 1: Use explicit casting to apply the correct cast type
>- Exercise 2: Fix the script so it correctly outputs the bill total

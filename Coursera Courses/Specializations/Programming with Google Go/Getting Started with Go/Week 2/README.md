# Week 2 <br> Basic Data Types

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the fundamental data types in Go.
- Explain how program flow is controlled in Go.
- Describe the process of garbage collection.
- Write and implement a Go program that manipulates floating-point numbers and performs truncation.
- Write and implement a Go program that manipulates strings.

## Subjects covered
- pointers
- variable scope
- garbage collection
- types
- some basic packages
- constants
- control flow

## Assignments

There are two assignments for week 2: 

#### 1. Simple type conversion

>"Write a program which prompts the user to enter a floating point number and prints the integer which is a truncated version of the floating point number that was entered. Truncation is the process of removing the digits to the right of the decimal place."

#### 2. Use of **"strings" package** and simple **control flow** (if-else)

>"Write a program which prompts the user to enter a string. The program searches through the entered string for the characters ‘i’, ‘a’, and ‘n’. The program should print “Found!” if the entered string starts with the character ‘i’, ends with the character ‘n’, and contains the character ‘a’. The program should print “Not Found!” otherwise. The program should not be case-sensitive, so it does not matter if the characters are upper-case or lower-case."

Basically [any running program](./HelloWorld.go) will do.

Two assignments: 
1. **Simple type conversion**.[^1]
2. Use of **"strings" package** and simple **control flow** (if-else).[^2]
[^1]: "Write a program which prompts the user to enter a floating point number and prints the integer which is a truncated version of the floating point number that was entered. Truncation is the process of removing the digits to the right of the decimal place."
[^2]: Write a program which prompts the user to enter a string. The program searches through the entered string for the characters ‘i’, ‘a’, and ‘n’. The program should print “Found!” if the entered string starts with the character ‘i’, ends with the character ‘n’, and contains the character ‘a’. The program should print “Not Found!” otherwise. The program should not be case-sensitive, so it does not matter if the characters are upper-case or lower-case."

Week 4 is about protocols and standards
- Protocol packages
- JSON 
- file access (ioutil, os)

Two assignments: 
1. **Create JSON from user input** "Write a program which prompts the user to first enter a name, and then enter an address. Your program should create a map and add the name and address to the map using the keys “name” and “address”, respectively. Your program should use Marshal() to create a JSON object from the map, and then your program should print the JSON object."
2. **Create structs from file** "Your program should prompt the user for the name of the text file. Your program will successively read each line of the text file and create a struct which contains the first and last names found in the file. Each struct created will be added to a slice, and after all lines have been read from the file, your program will have a slice containing one struct for each line in the file. After reading all lines from the file, your program should iterate through your slice of structs and print the first and last names found in each struct."

## Courses of the specialization

---

1. [Getting Started with Go](./Getting%20Started%20with%20Go)
2. [Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go](./Functions,%20Methods,%20and%20Interfaces%20in%20Go)
3. [Concurrency in Go](./Concurrency%20in%20Go)

(Interestingly enough the logos of the courses suggest that the specialization might have been planned to be a 4 course specialization. It indeed consists these 3 courses only.)

## Personal impressions

The courses are well structured, the lecturer knows what he wants to teach and what he does not. Programming assignments are well-focused on their module. Lecturer hands out all the slides of the last two courses. It is interesting to see how the lecturer's strong background in hardware comes through in the lectures. This gives a special value to the courses.

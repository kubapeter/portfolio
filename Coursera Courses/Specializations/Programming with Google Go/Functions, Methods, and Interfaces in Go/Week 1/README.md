Week 1: FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

Learning Objectives

- Identify the basic features and purposes of functions.
- Identify the benefits of using pointers when working with functions.
- Identify the difference between passing a slice and an array as function arguments.
- Use functions and a slice to implement a sorting routine for integers.

There is one assignment for this week. Bubble sort algorithm. [^1]
[^1]: "Write a Bubble Sort program in Go. The program should prompt the user to type in a sequence of up to 10 integers. The program should print the integers out on one line, in sorted order, from least to greatest. 
  As part of this program, you should write a function called BubbleSort() which takes a slice of integers as an argument and returns nothing. The BubbleSort() function should modify the slice so that the elements are in sorted order."

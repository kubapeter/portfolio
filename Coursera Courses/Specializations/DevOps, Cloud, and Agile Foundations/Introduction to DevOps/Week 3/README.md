# Week 3 <br> Working DevOps

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the negative effects of working in silos.
- Recognize why software engineering projects should not be treated like civil engineering projects.
- Describe the behaviors emphasized in DevOps.
- Describe the benefits of using Infrastructure as Code in a DevOps environment.
- Describe how Continuous Delivery enables release to production at any time.
- Describe how Continuous Integration creates more stable code.

## Highlights
- Taylorism was designed for factory work and software development is bespoke, that is, more like craftwork, and that working in silos leads to mistakes and bottlenecks. 
- Team ownership and stable teams make software development more like product development rather than project management. 
- Developers want innovation, while Operations want stability. 
- Required DevOps behaviors include shared ownership, collaboration, embracing change, and data-driven responses. 
- Infrastructure as Code is describing infrastructure in a textual executable format. 
- Ephemeral infrastructure can be used and then discarded because servers are built on demand, via automation, using Infrastructure as Code techniques. 
- Continuous Integration is building, testing, and integrating every developer change into the master branch after tests have passed. 
- The benefits of Continuous Integration include faster reaction time, moving faster, and reducing the risk in integrating code. 
- Continuous Delivery ensures that code can be rapidly and safely deployed to production by delivering every change to a production-like environment. 
- The five principles of Continuous Delivery have to do with quality, working in small batches, automation, continuous improvement, and shared responsibility.

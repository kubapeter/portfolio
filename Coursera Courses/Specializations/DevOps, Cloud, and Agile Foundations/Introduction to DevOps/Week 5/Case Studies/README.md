# Scenario 1 Thinking DevOps

>The Acme company decided to implement DevOps. Since they already had a Dev team and an Ops team, they thought the best approach was to create a new DevOps team in addition to the already existing teams. They thought it would cause minimal disruption to the existing teams. They also allowed the teams to continue to use the ticket system.
>
>Miguel has just joined the new DevOps team at the Acme company. He has been instructed to work closely with the Dev team and the Ops team as a liaison. In his normal day, he maintains the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and makes sure that the developers have what they need from Ops and makes sure that Ops has what they need from the developers. When the Dev team has a request, Miguel uses the ticket queue to make that request to Ops on Dev’s behalf. One morning, the Dev team needed virtual machines (VMs) provisioned in a hurry to deploy their application by the deadline.
>
>Miguel thought he had a good relationship with Charles, the SysAdmin, and asked him if he could get the VMs done that day. Charles curtly reminded him that they had a well-established ticket queue system, and that he would have to open a ticket like everyone else. Miguel opened a ticket and let the developers know that he made the request for the VMs. Several days passed. Nancy, on the Dev team, asked Miguel where the VMs were. She reminded him about the deadline and said, “We’ll miss it unless you get us those VMs.”
>
>Two more days passed. In a meeting with the Dev team, Jim, one of the team members, said, “Well, I do kind of have access to something.” He explained that he had a personal Cloud account where he could have the VMs provisioned within the hour. Miguel asked whether this was in concert with corporate policy. Jim replied, “We have to do what it takes to meet customer commitments.” They deployed the application on Jim’s cloud account.

Questions: 

1. How could the company organize to reflect a DevOps culture?
2. Which of these is a positive step toward having a DevOps culture?
3. How could the application deployment have been handled that would be consistent with DevOps culture?

# Week 4 <br> Module A <br> Organizing for DevOps

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the organizational impact of DevOps.
- Describe team structure in DevOps.
- Describe how making everyone responsible for success leads to success.

## Highlights
- Measure and reward what you want to improve. 
- People seek information on what is rewarded and then seek to do that. 
- Measuring social metrics leads to improved teamwork and measuring DevOps metrics allows you to see the progression toward your goals. 
- If you want people to be social, then measure them being social. 
- DevOps changes the objective of problem resolution from failure prevention to failure recovery. 
- Vanity metrics may be appealing at first but offer limited actionable insights. 
- Actionable metrics provide meaningful ways to measure your processes and take action toward goals. 
- DevOps actionable metrics include mean lead time, release frequency, change failure rate, and mean time to recovery. 
- You can rate statements developed by Dr. Nicole Forsgren to measure your teamâ€™s culture, including statements about information, failures, collaboration, and new ideas. 
- Mean lead time is the measure of how long it takes for an idea to get to production. 
- Change failure rate is the rate of failure from pushing new releases out. 
- Mean time to recovery is how long it takes to recover from a failure. 
- Failures are learning opportunities that should not be punished. 
- Dr. Nicole Forsgren developed cultural statements for measuring team culture.

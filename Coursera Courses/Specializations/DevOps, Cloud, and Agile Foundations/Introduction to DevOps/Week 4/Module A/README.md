## Learning Objectives

- DevOps solves problems caused by siloed teams. 
- DevOps is the practice of development and operations engineers working together during the entire software lifecycle, following lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver high-quality results. 
- Actions without consequences can lead to apathy. 
- Allowing teams to feel the effect of their actions fosters empathy, resulting in higher-quality work.

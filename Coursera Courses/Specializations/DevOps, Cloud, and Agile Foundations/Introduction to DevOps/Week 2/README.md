# Week 2 <br> Thinking DevOps

## Learning Objectives
- Describe social coding principles
- Describe the benefits of working in small batches
- Define minimum viable product
- Describe test driven development
- Describe behavior driven development
- Describe key advantages of using cloud native microservices
- Describe how designing for failure benefits the development process

## Highlights
- Social coding is coding as a community and public repositories and pair programming result in higher code quality. 
- Working in small batches reduces waste and means quickly delivering something useful to the customer. 
- Minimum viable product is as much about delivery as it is about building what the customer really desires. 
- Test driven development is writing the test for the code you wish you had, then writing the code to make the test pass. It allows you to develop faster and with more confidence.
- Behavior driven development focuses on the behavior of the system from the outside in. It looks at the system as a consumer of it. 
- Behavior driven development improves communication by using an approachable syntax that developers and stakeholders can understand. 
- Microservices are built around business capabilities and are independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.  
- Cloud native architecture enables independently deployable microservices that take advantage of horizontal scaling and result in more resilient services. 
- Failure is inevitable, so we design for failure rather than trying to avoid failure. 
- It is important to embrace failure and quickly recover when failures happen.

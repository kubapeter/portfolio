## Course description

>"This course provides an introduction to the Java language and object-oriented programming, including an overview of Java syntax and how it differs from a language like Python.

[^1]: For ethical reasons I do not share my assignments. It is strictly against [Coursera Honor Code](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code?language=en_US). However, for every assignment I give a detailed description of the original problem, I highlight the main principles and techniques the problem wants to check, and I share the source code of another similar problem. The publicly available source code uses approximately the same principles and techniques as the original (sometimes a bit more).

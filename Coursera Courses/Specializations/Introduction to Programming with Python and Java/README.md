## Description of the specialization

>"This Specialization starts out by teaching basic concepts in Python and ramps up to more complex subjects such as object-oriented programming and data structures in Java. By the time learners complete this series of four courses, they will be able to write fully-functional programs in both Python and Java, two of the most well-known and frequently used programming languages in the world today.
>
>Introduction to Programming with Python and Java is for students and professionals who have minimal or no prior programming exposure. Itâ€™s for motivated learners who have experience with rigorous coursework, and are looking to gain a competitive edge in advancing their career.  \[...\] We hope this Specialization is for you.
>
>Topics in this Specialization include language syntax, style, programming techniques, and coding conventions. Learn about best practices and good code design, code testing and test-driven development, code debugging, code and program documentation, and computational thinking."

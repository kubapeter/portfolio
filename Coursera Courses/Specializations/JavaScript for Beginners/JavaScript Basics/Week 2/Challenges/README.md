# Challenges 

## Challenge 1

>Create an HTML file and set the title to "JavaScript Basic Challenges: Challenge 1" Then add an \<h1\> and \<h2\> with that information. 
>
>Then add a script tag before the closing \</body\> tag and between the script tags create two variables. Assign your first name to one and your last name to the other, then make JavaScript display the value of each variable in the console. 

## Challenge 2

>Change the title and the headings on the challenge1.html file and save it as challenge2.html.
>
>Use plus signs (+) and your two variables to write your first name and last name to the console on one line with a space between your names.

## Challenge 3

>Update and save the file again, this time as challenge3.html
>
>Add one more variable called "adjective" and assign it a value that describes you. Use the console to display a sentence that includes all three variables. This time use a template literal (tick marks, and ${} around variables).

## Challenge 4

>Update and save the file again, this time as challenge4.html 
>
>In JavaScript, `prompt()` can be used like this: 

```js
    var name = prompt("what's your name?", "Bob"); 
```

>When the page loads a prompt will appear and the user can add some text. "Bob" is the default text. If you don't want default text, you can leave the second set of quotes empty.
>
>Write script that prompts the user for their name, and then display a sentence in the console that greets the user by name and welcomes them.

## Challenge 5

>Update and save the file again, this time as challenge5.html
>
>This time, use prompt and ask the user for a whole number. If they type in a number less than 10, have the console log report, "You entered a number smaller than 10", otherwise, send "You entered a big number" to the console.

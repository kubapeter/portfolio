# Challenges 

## Challenge 1

>Create an HTML file and set the title to "JavaScript Basic Challenges: Challenge 1" Then add an \<h1\> and \<h2\> with that information. 
>
>Then add a script tag before the closing \</body\> tag and between the script tags create two variables. Assign your first name to one and your last name to the other, then make JavaScript display the value of each variable in the console. 

## Challenge 2

>Change the title and the headings on the challenge1.html file and save it as challenge2.html.
>
>Use plus signs (+) and your two variables to write your first name and last name to the console on one line with a space between your names.

## Challenge 3

>Update and save the file again, this time as challenge3.html
>
>Add one more variable called "adjective" and assign it a value that describes you. Use the console to display a sentence that includes all three variables. This time use a template literal (tick marks, and ${} around variables).

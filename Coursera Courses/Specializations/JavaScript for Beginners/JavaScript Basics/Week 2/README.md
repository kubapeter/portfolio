# Week 2 <br> Controlling Logical Flow in JavaScript

## Learning Objectives
- Download and install a code editor.
- Use the code editor to create HTML files.
- Manage files and folders.
- Use the explorer in Visual Studio Code to organize and link to files.
- Identify selection structures within programs.
- Identify expressions that evaluate to `true` or `false` in JavaScript.
- Write the syntax necessary for creating selection structures in JavaScript.
- Troubleshoot scripts when they have errors.
- Use a code editor to write scripts.
- Correctly identify loop structures in programming.
- Use correct syntax to write loops in JavaScript.
- Identify and fix errors in the program when they occur.
- Write basic JavaScript programs in a code editor and run them in the browser.
- Combine logic flow control structures within simple programs.
- Output program results to the console window.
- Create custom functions that can be called to complete the instructions they contain.
- Practice working with combining control structures (sequence, selection and loop) and creating functions to create basic programs that output to the browser console.

## Subjects covered
- Operators: `+`, `=`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Booleans, selection: `true`, `false`, `if`, `else`
- `undefined`, `0`, `NaN` and `null` evaluates to `false`, everything else evaluates to `true`
- `=` and `==`; type coercion (`5 == "5"` is `true`); `===` and `!==` (no type coercion)
- ``else if`, `switch`
- `&&`, `||`
- `for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {...}`
- `for (var element of array) {...}`
- `for (var letter of string) {...}`
- `while`
- `'the square of ${myNum} is ${myNum * myNum}'`
- string methods

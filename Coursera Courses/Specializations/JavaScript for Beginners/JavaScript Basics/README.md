## Course description

>"This course introduces the programming language JavaScript and shows the websites that include the type of interactions students will eventually be able to develop.

Learners will write their first scripts, have their HTML and CSS skills assessed, create variables and arrays and assign values to them.  If studentâ€™s skills are lacking, resources and recommendations are provided to improve these skills. There is ample opportunity for students to practice these first, core skills."

[^1]: For ethical reasons I do not make my assignments publicly available. It is strictly against [Coursera Honor Code](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code?language=en_US). However, for every assignment I give a detailed description of the original problem, I highlight the main principles and techniques the problem wants to check, and I share the source code of another similar problem. The publicly available source code uses approximately the same principles and techniques as the original (sometimes a bit more).

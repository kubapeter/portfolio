# Challenges 

## [Challenge 17](./challenge17.html)

>For each of these challenges, use the [start file](./start_file.html) and add `<script>` tags at the bottom of the page, just before the closing `</body>` tag, and put your JavaScript between those tags.
>
>Save each challenge as challenge17.html, etc.
>
>For this challenge, write a script that gets the text inside the paragraph with the `id` set to `"copyright"` and use the `color` property to change the color of the text to `green`.

## [Challenge 18](./challenge18.html)

>For this challenge, get all the paragraphs on the page, assign them to a variable, then use that variable in a loop to set the `style.color` property to `green`.

## [Challenge 19](./challenge19.html)

>For this challenge, assign the class of `.red` (which is already defined inside the `style` tags at the top of the page) to the `<h1>` in the header and to the date in the second article.

## [Challenge 20](./challenge20.html)

>For this challenge, change the `src` attribute for the first picture in the first article to:
>
>"http://meadpoint.net/images/xmasajax.jpg"
>
>Also add the class `blue` to all the paragraphs in the second article.

## [Challenge 21](./challenge21.html)

>For this challenge, get all the links, then check to see if one of them is set to go to the wikipedia page on llamas, if it is, set the text of that link to "Llamas are cool!"
>
>_Hint_
>
>Use these document methods and properties: 
>
>`.getElementsByTagName();`
>
>`.getAttribute();`
>
>`.innerHTML = "";`
>
>You will have multiple anchor tags to check and you're looking to see if one of them matches, so that should tell you what logical flow control structures you need.

## [Challenge 22](./challenge22.html)

>Make an HTML file with a paragraph and a button. When you click the button, make the paragraph turn green. 
>
>For now put `<script>` tags at the bottom of the page, before the closing `</body>` tag.


## [Challenge 23](./challenge23.html)

>Add a few more paragraphs. When you click the button, all the paragraphs turn green.

## [Challenge 24](./challenge24.html)

>Change the HTML so that there is a div around one paragraph. Make it so that when you click the button a new paragraph is added to the div, with the text, "A new paragraph" in it.
>
>You may need to go back to the slides on changing the DOM to see how to do this.

## [Challenge 25](./challenge25.html)

>For this challenge, add an additional button that removes the last paragraph from the div.

## [Challenge 26](./challenge26.html)

>For this challenge, change the first paragraph so that it says, "This is paragraph number 1".
>
>Each time the user presses the add paragraph button, the number at the end of the statement increments.
>
>When the user clicks the remove paragraph button, it functions as normal, but alerts the user if they try to delete the last paragraph.

## [Challenge 27](./challenge27.html)

>Add a form. When the user submits a number, change the size of the font for the h1 to be equal to the number they submitted in pixels.
>
>If no number is entered, or something other than a number is entered, alert that the user must enter a number.
>
>To make this work you will have to prevent the default behavior for the form submission.

## [Challenge 28](./challenge28.html)

>For this challenge, create the HTML and CSS on the right. Then write a script that when you hover the mouse over the div, it adds the class `big`.
>
>Write a second event handler for when the mouse goes off the div, it removes the class `big`.

## [Challenge 29](./challenge29.html)

>Create the HTML & CSS as shown.
>
>Write a script that changes the class on the body tag for each 500 pixels the user scrolls. At 500px down the page the body gets class two, and at 1000 it gets class three, etc.
>
>You can use `if`/`else` statements, but try using a `switch` statement!

## [Challenge 30](./challenge30.html)

>Change the HTML and CSS to this, then write a script that changes the class on the body tag based on the key that was pressed.
>
>If someone presses a different key, give them a nasty alert message.
>
>Use the `switch` statement again.

# Challenges 

## [Challenge 17](./challenge17.html)

>For each of these challenges, use the start file and add `\<script\>` tags at the bottom of the page, just before the closing \</body\> tag, and put your JavaScript between those tags.
>
>Save each challenge as challenge17.html, etc.
>
>For this challenge, write a script that gets the text inside the paragraph with the id set to "copyright" and use the color property to change the color of the text to green.

## [Challenge 18](./challenge18.html)

>Change the title and the headings on the challenge1.html file and save it as challenge2.html.
>
>Use plus signs (+) and your two variables to write your first name and last name to the console on one line with a space between your names.

## [Challenge 19](./challenge19.html)

>Update and save the file again, this time as challenge3.html
>
>Add one more variable called "adjective" and assign it a value that describes you. Use the console to display a sentence that includes all three variables. This time use a template literal (tick marks, and ${} around variables).

## [Challenge 20](./challenge20.html)

>Update and save the file again, this time as challenge4.html 
>
>In JavaScript, `prompt()` can be used like this: 

```js
    var name = prompt("what's your name?", "Bob"); 
```

>When the page loads a prompt will appear and the user can add some text. "Bob" is the default text. If you don't want default text, you can leave the second set of quotes empty.
>
>Write script that prompts the user for their name, and then display a sentence in the console that greets the user by name and welcomes them.

## [Challenge 21](./challenge21.html)

>Update and save the file again, this time as challenge5.html
>
>This time, use prompt and ask the user for a whole number. If they type in a number less than 10, have the console log report, "You entered a number smaller than 10", otherwise, send "You entered a big number" to the console.

## [Challenge 6](./challenge06.html)

>Update and save the file again, this time as challenge6.html
>
>Notice in challenge 5, if a user types something other than a number, the console tells us they entered a big number. In this challenge, fix that so that if a user types something other than a number, the console displays a message that says there was an error.

## [Challenge 7](./challenge07.html)

>Update and save the file again, this time as challenge7.html
>
>For this challenge, if the user types a number less than 10, use a loop to print out the numbers from zero to 9 in the console.

## [Challenge 8](./challenge08.html)

>Update and save the file again, this time as challenge8.htm 
>
>For this challenge, if the user types a number less than 10, update the loop from the last challenge so that the console indicates the number the user entered.

## [Challenge 9](./challenge09.html)

>Prompt the user for a color, then have the console report if the user typed a primary color (red, blue, or yellow) or a secondary color (orange, green or purple) or none of these. 
>
>Handle the situation for both uppercase and lowercase letters in the color the user types in. 
>
>_Hint: remember the || means 'or'_

## [Challenge 10](./challenge10.html)

>Write a function called `hello()` that outputs a greeting in the console when the function runs.

## [Challenge 11](./challenge11.html)

>For this challenge, change `hello()` so that it takes a parameter, and when you run the function, you pass in the name of a person and the function outputs the greeting to the console.

## [Challenge 12](./challenge12.html)

>This time, add a prompt requesting the user for their name, and assign the result to a variable.
>
>Then pass that variable into the `hello()` function so that the console greets the person by name.

## [Challenge 13](./challenge13.html)

>For this challenge handle the situation that happens if the user clicks cancel on the prompt, or does not enter text in the prompt. 
>
>If the user does one of those two actions, have the `hello()` function log to the console "You didn't give me your name". Otherwise, have the console log the greeting.
>
>_Hint: What do you get if, in challenge 12, you click cancel or put no text in the prompt?_

## [Challenge 14](./challenge14.html)

>For this challenge, update the `hello()` function so that it returns a value rather than outputs directly to the console. 
>
>I used a variable: `var greeting;` and returned that variable at the end of the function. 
>
>Then outside the function write a call to the console that logs the greeting returned by the function.

## [Challenge 15](./challenge15.html)

>For this challenge, add an array of foods and put 3-5 elements in the array. Then make a new function called `hospitality();` after the `hello();` function. 
>
>The new function will take two parameters, a name and a gift, which will be an array. Have this function run the `hello()` function and output the result to the console. Then have it loop through the gift array and offer a gift to the visitor by name and output that to the console.

## [Challenge 16](./challenge16.html)

>For this challenge, add the function that gets random integers from the functions lecture. 
>
>Update the `hospitality()` function so that, instead of looping through the whole array, randomly picks one element from the array and offers that to the user.

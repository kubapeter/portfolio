# Programming in Python: A Hands-on Introduction Specialization

Offered by 
### *codio*

Taught by: [Elise Deitrick](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/edeitrick) and
[Patrick Ester](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~80011875)

---

**40 hours** to complete ([certificate](./Coursera_Certification_Programming_in_Python_A_Hands-on_Introduction_Specialization.pdf), [verification](https://coursera.org/verify/specialization/A3B8C22QLJDX))

The specialization consists of 4 courses.

## Description of the specialization

>"This course is designed for learners with limited coding experience, providing a solid foundation of not just python, but core Computer Science topics that can be transferred to other languages. The modules in this course cover inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and other object-related topics. Completion of the prior 3 courses in this specialization is recommended.
>
>To allow for a truly hands-on, self-paced learning experience, this course is video-free. Assignments contain short explanations with images and runnable code examples with suggested edits to explore code examples further, building a deeper understanding by doing. You'll benefit from instant feedback from a variety of assessment items along the way, gently progressing from quick understanding checks (multiple choice, fill in the blank, and un-scrambling code blocks) to small, approachable coding exercises that take minutes instead of hours."

2. [Python Basic Structures: Lists, Strings, and Files](./Java%20Basic%20Structures:%20Arrays,%20Strings,%20and%20Files)
3. [Python Object Basics: Functions, Recursion, and Objects](./Java%20Object%20Basics:%20Functions,%20Recursion,%20and%20Objects)

## Remarks
- The philosophy of the whole specialization is learning by doing. There are no videos, all the concepts are taught by code examples, and coding puzzles. 
- A very well documented specialization. From its pdf documents one can really get a deep insight into the course.

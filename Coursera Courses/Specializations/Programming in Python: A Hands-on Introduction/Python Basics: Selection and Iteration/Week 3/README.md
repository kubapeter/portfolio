## [Coding practice challenge](./lab_challenge.py)

>"Write a program that determines the month of the year based on the value of a variable called `month`. The variable will be a number from 1 to 12 (`1` is January, `2` is February, etc.). Use a `print` statement to write the month to the screen.
>
>**Important**, you will need to declare the variable `month` as you write and test your code. However, **do not** submit your code to be graded with the variable declaration. The auto-grader will declare the variable for you."

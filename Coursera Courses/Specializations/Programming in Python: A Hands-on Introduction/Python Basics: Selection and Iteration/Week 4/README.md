# Week 4 <br> Loops

## Learning Objectives
- Explain for loop syntax (especially the whitespace)
- Identify the relationship between patterns, loops, and output
- Explain while loop syntax (especially the whitespace)
- Identify the causes of an infinite loop
- Describe the break statement as it relates to a while loop
- Explain nested loop syntax (especially the whitespace)
- Identify the relationship between the variables in each loop with the output produced

## [Coding practice challenge](./lab_challenge.py)

>"Loops Challenge
>
>For this challenge, you will output a pattern that resembles a chessboard by using the letter `X` and `O`. The pattern needs to be an 8 x 8 matrix with alternating `X` and `O` in each row. Here is the catch, you must also ensure that alternate rows start with a different letter than the previous row.
Here is the required output.

```
XOXOXOXO
OXOXOXOX
XOXOXOXO
OXOXOXOX
XOXOXOXO
OXOXOXOX
XOXOXOXO
OXOXOXOX
```
>You should make use of a looping structure in combination with a decision structure to achieve this result. Also, by default, Python’s print() function will add the newline character at the end of each print() function so to ensure that this newline does not create a long, single column output of the letters, use this syntax for your print() functions, print(‘X’, end=’’). Note the use of , end=’’ after the letter to output."

# Week 3 <br> Files

## Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate how to use the `writelines` method
- Differentiate between `open` and `with open`
- Demonstrate how to open a file in write mode and append mode
- Explain what happens when you write to a file that already exists versus a file that does not exist
- Write to a CSV file with `writerow` and `writerows`
- Unpack `for` loop variables based on a CSV file
- Print the contents of CSV file in a human-readable way
- Find a keyword with the `seek` method
- Read from one file and write to another
- Differentiate between “read and write” and “read and append”
- Iterate through a file line by line (`for` loop and `while` loop)

## [Coding practice challenge](./lab_challenge.py)

>Write a program that reads the text file `student_folder/.labs/myanmar.txt`. The file contains several instances of the word `Burma`. Replace each instance of `Burma` with `Myanmar`, and print the results of this transformation. The final output of your program should be:

```
Myanmar is a country in Southeast Asia.
The capital of Myanmar is Naypyidaw.
Its population is about 54 million people.
Myanmar is a former British colony.
```

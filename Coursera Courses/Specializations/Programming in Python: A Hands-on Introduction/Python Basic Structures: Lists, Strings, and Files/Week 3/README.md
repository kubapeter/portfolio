# Week 3 <br> Files

## Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate how to use the `writelines` method
- Differentiate between `open` and `with open`
- Demonstrate how to open a file in write mode and append mode
- Explain what happens when you write to a file that already exists versus a file that does not exist
- Write to a CSV file with `writerow` and `writerows`
- Unpack `for` loop variables based on a CSV file
- Print the contents of CSV file in a human-readable way
- Find a keyword with the `seek` method
- Read from one file and write to another
- Differentiate between “read and write” and “read and append”
- Iterate through a file line by line (`for` loop and `while` loop)

## [Coding practice challenge](./lab_challenge.py)

>"Changing a List
>
>Write a program that takes a list of integers called `numbers` and will print a list with the elements `odd` or `even` based on the elements of `numbers`. For example, if `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then your program will print `['odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even']`."

## [Coding practice challenge](./lab_challenge.py)

>"Replacing Vowels with a \*
>
>You are going to write a program that takes a string called `my_string` and returns the string but with a `*` in the place of vowels. Assume that vowels are `a, e, i, o, u`. For example, if `my_string = "Hello"`, then your program will print `"H*ll*"`."

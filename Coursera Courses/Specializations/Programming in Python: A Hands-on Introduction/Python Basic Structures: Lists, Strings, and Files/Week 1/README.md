## [Coding practice challenge](./lab_challenge.py)

>"Changing a List
>
>Write a program that takes a list of integers called `numbers` and will print a list with the elements `odd` or `even` based on the elements of `numbers`. For example, if `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then your program will print `['odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even']`."

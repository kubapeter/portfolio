# Week 3 <br> Introduction to Objects

## Learning Objectives
- Define the terms class, objects, instance, and instantiate
- Identify the difference between classes and objects
- Add an attribute to an object with dot notation
- Explain the difference between shallow and deep copies

## [Coding practice challenge](./lab_challenge.py)

>"Create the variable `dog1`, and instantiate an object of the `Dog` class. This dogâ€™s name is `Marceline` and she is a `German Shepherd`. Create the variable `dog2` and make a **deep copy** of `dog1`. `dog2` should be named `Cajun` and have the breed `Belgian Malinois`. Test your code by printing the `name` and `breed` of each dog to make sure they fulfill the requirements above."

# Week 2 <br> Using SQL Techniques

## Learning Objectives
- Produce properly normalized tables from CSV files.
- Utilize the ALTER TABLE command to adjust the schema of tables.

## Subjects covered
- Just [coding demonstrations](./demos.sql) this week. 

## Assignments[^1]
- **From CSV to many-to-one**
  - 2 assignments: the first one is basic, the second is more complex 
  - Same structure: load CSV data file into table, then normalize the data with SQL commands. 
- **From CSV to many-to-one**. >"This application will read an iTunes library in comma-separated-values (CSV) and produce properly normalized many-to-many tables relating tracks to artists.  We also use the ALTER TABLE command to adjust the schema of the tables after we have finished processing."

[^1]:Please note, that I do not share the solutions of the assignments, as the lecturer firmly asks not to. However, I share the [source code](./demos.sql) of all the coding demonstrations of the week. This gives a code-level insight into the week. It covers everything that is needed to get through the assignments with 100% of the points.

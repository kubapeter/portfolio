# Week 1 <br> Natural Language

## Learning Objectives
- Recall why PostgreSQL stores rows in blocks with unused space on disk.
- Recall the typical block size used by PostgreSQL.
- Differentiate between HASH index and B-tree index.
- Create a reverse index for a table of documents.
- Utilize stop words with a reverse index.

## Subjects covered
- 


## Assignments[^1]
- Initial database setup (get used to the course settings)
- Alter table
- Use `SELECT DISTINCT`
- Add a stored procedure so that every time a record is updated, the updated_at variable is automatically set to the current time. 

[^1]:Please note, that I do not share the solutions of the assignments, as the lecturer firmly asks not to. However, I share the [source code](./demos.sql) of all the coding demonstrations of the week. This gives a code-level insight into the week. It covers everything that is needed to get through the assignments with 100% of the points.

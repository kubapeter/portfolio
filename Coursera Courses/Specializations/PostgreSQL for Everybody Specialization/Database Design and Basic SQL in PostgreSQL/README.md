## Course description

>"In this course you will learn more about the historical design of databases and the use of SQL in the PostgreSQL environment. Using SQL techniques and common commands (INSERT INTO, WHERE, ORDER BY, ON DELETE CASCADE, etc) will enable you to create tables, column types and define the schema of your data in PostgreSQL. You will learn about data modeling and how to represent one-to-many and many-to-many relationships in PostgreSQL. Students will do hands-on assignments creating tables, inserting data, designing data models, creating relational structures and inserting and querying relational data in tables."

## Syllabus
- [Week 1](./Week%201): Introduction to SQL
- [Week 2](./Week%202): Single Table SQL
- [Week 3](./Week%203): One-To-Many Data Models
- [Week 4](./Week%204): Many-To-Many Data Models

## Remarks
- The main focus of this course is on database desing, one-to-many, many-to-many relations, and not on querying information from existing tables. 
- This is *not really an introductory course* to SQL. The basics (e. g. how `SELECT` works) are not detailed, or not mentioned at all. For example the student almost certainly has to use `DROP` at one point or another, but this command is not discussed. Some really basic functionality is not discussed either, like `GROUP BY`. 
- All SQL commands are run from *command line* in this course. 
- The lecturer did a very careful job to make the submission of the assignments technically easy. An autograder checks the assignments.

## Practice Exercises

For ethical reasons I do not share the correct answers for the coding quiz. But I share the [code for the practice quiz](./exercise.sql), which is quite similar but not graded. From this, one can get a more detailed insight of what is covered in week 1. 

All of the questions in the practice quiz pull from the open source Chinook Database. Its ER Diagram can be seen below.

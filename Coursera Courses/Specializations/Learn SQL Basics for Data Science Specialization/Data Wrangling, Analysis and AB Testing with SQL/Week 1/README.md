# Week 1 <br> Data of Unknown Quality 

## Learning Objectives
- Create trustworthy analysis from a new dataset.
- Coalesce some nulls and identify unreliable data.
- Discover reasons why data might be missing.
- Answer ambiguous questions by defining new metrics.

## Subjects covered
- pivoting data
- segmenting and visualizing data to check for completeness
- identifying reasons why data might be missing
- handling abiguous questions

## Practice Exercises

There are 4 practice exercises for this week. 
- The [first](./error_codes.sql) helps to get to know the database better through problematic queries
- The [second](./flexible_data_formats.sql) shows a way in 4 steps to format selected data into a table with pivot
- The [third](./identifying_unreliable_data_nulls.sql) offers practices to check if data can be trusted
- The [fourth](./Practice%20Exercises/counting_users.sql) shows that simple real life questions about the data set can be quite complicated to answer correctly

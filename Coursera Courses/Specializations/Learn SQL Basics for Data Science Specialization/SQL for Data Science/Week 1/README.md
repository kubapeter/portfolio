# Week 1 <br> Getting Started and Selecting & Retrieving Data with SQL

## Learning Objectives
- Distinguish between use of SQL for data science applications and SQL for more common data management operations.
- Use an Entity Relationship diagram, describing the data elements, their relationships, and inter-dependencies and determine if the existent data is sufficient to address a business question.
- Retrieve one or more columns of data from a table that relates to the research topic.
- Identify a subset of data needed from a column or set of columns and write a SQL query to limit to those results.
- Create an analysis environment and use INSERT to put data into a table.
- Add effective comments in your queries so that one, you can remember what you're doing, and two, so others can review your work.

## Practice Exercises

For ethical reasons I do not share the correct answers for the coding quiz. But I share the [code for the practice quiz](./exercise.sql). From this, one can get a more detailed insight of what is covered in week 1.

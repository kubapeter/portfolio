# Week 1 <br> Subqueries and Joins in SQL

## Learning Objectives
- Retrieve data from multiple tables using subqueries.
- Join tables using an Inner Join and table aliases.
- Filter a given data set using set theory by joining tables using Natural, Outer, and Self Joins.
- Assess the risk versus benefit of using a Cross Join or Cartesian Join on a set of data.
- Create an analysis table from multiple queries using the UNION operator.

## Practice Exercises

For ethical reasons I do not share the correct answers for the coding quiz. But I share the [code for the practice quiz](./exercise.sql), which is quite similar but not graded. From this, one can get a more detailed insight of what is covered in week 3.

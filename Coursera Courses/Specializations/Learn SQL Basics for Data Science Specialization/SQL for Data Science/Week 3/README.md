# Week 3 <br> Subqueries and Joins in SQL

## Learning Objectives
- Retrieve data from multiple tables using subqueries.
- Join tables using an `INNER JOIN` and table aliases.
- Filter a given data set using set theory by joining tables using Natural, Outer, and Self Joins.
- Assess the risk versus benefit of using a Cross Join or Cartesian Join on a set of data.
- Create an analysis table from multiple queries using the `UNION` operator.

## Practice Exercises

For ethical reasons I do not share the correct answers for the coding quiz. But I share the [code for the practice quiz](./exercise.sql), which is quite similar but not graded. From this, one can get a more detailed insight of what is covered in week 3. 

All of the questions in the practice quiz pull from the open source Chinook Database. Its ER Diagram can be seen below.

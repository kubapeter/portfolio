# Week 4 <br> Filtering, Sorting, and Calculating Data with SQL

## Learning Objectives
- Manipulate strings, dates, and numeric data using functions to integrate data from different sources into fields with the correct format for analysis.
- Use `CASE` / `WHEN` statements to recode a set of data for grouping at a different level (e.g. cities to regions).
- Use Views to simplify SQL operations
- Identify organizational, governance, business, and data conditions that indicate use of a `JOIN` to prepare data for analysis.
- Recite and implement the 3 rules for changing an analysis question into a SQL statement

## Practice Exercises

For ethical reasons I do not share the correct answers for the coding quiz. But I share the [code for the practice quiz](./exercise.sql), which is quite similar but not graded. From this, one can get a more detailed insight of what is covered in week 4. 

All of the questions in the practice quiz pull from the open source Chinook Database. Its ER Diagram can be seen below.

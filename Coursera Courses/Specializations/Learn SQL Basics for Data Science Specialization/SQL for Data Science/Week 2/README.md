# Week 2 <br> Filtering, Sorting, and Calculating Data with SQL

## Learning Objectives
- Compare analytics tool and CPU time performance between a filtered and unfiltered dataset.
- Given a dataset analysis requirement, use `WHERE`, `IN`, `NOT`, `AND`, and `OR` alone or in combination to filter the dataset.
- Determine whether or not to use wildcards in a data filter or search situation.
- Use wildcards to search or filter data based on requirements. Use regular expressions for text processing
- Use `ORDER BY` to sort data according to requirements for number of columns in the sort, sort direction, and sort position.
- Create common math operation calculated fields and aliases for calculated fields.
- Use `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM` to profile data.
- Summarize data according to one or more criterion using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses.

## Practice Exercises

For ethical reasons I do not share the correct answers for the coding quiz. But I share the [code for the practice quiz](./exercise.sql). From this, one can get a more detailed insight of what is covered in week 2.

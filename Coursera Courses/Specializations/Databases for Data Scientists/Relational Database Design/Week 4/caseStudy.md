# Step 1: Background

> "Your client, PetsCare, is a local clinic that takes care of pets, including pet wellness and vaccination, medical services, surgery including spay and neuter, dental cleaning and treatment, grooming, etc. PetsCare has served the community for more than 20 years, and has been successful in the business.
> 
> Recently, the current owner, Claire, who is the daughter of the founder of PetsCare, realized that the old file system solution is very inefficient. She and her team have to spend lots of time taking records, querying for information, and maintaining the data. She decided to turn to you, for a Relational Database Management System.
> 
> PetsCare wants to record information about customers, pets, staff, visits. Claire will be available to meet via Zoom tomorrow to discuss details. You should prepare questions for building the DBMS.
> 
> **Task:** What questions should you ask during the meeting?

# Step 2: Build the Entity Relationship Model

> "Congratulations! Thanks to the efficient communication between Claire and you, now you understand the details of the business, and you are ready to write down narrative statements for your Entity Relationship Model. 
> 
> You should lay out your own assumptions and your own ER Model."

# Step 3: Create the Entity Relationship Diagram



# Step 4: Convert the ERD to the Relational Model



# Step 5: Normalize the Relational Model to 3NF



# Step 6: Final Output for Implementation

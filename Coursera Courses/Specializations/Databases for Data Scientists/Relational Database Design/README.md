## Course description

>"Have you ever wanted to build a database but don't know where to start? This course will provide you a step-by-step guidance. We are going to start from a raw idea to an implementable relational database. Getting on the path, practicing the real-life mini cases, you will be confident and comfortable with Relational Database Design. Let's get started!
>
>Relational Database Design can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulder’s Master of Science in Data Science (MS-DS) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The MS-DS is an interdisciplinary degree that brings together faculty from CU Boulder’s departments of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Information Science, and others. With performance-based admissions and no application process, the MS-DS is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education and/or professional experience in computer science, information science, mathematics, and statistics. Learn more about the MS-DS program at https://www.coursera.org/degrees/master-of-science-data-science-boulder."

## Syllabus

### [Week 1](./Week%201): Introduction to DBMS, and Entity Relational Models

>Introduce students to Database Management Systems. Introduce and train students with how to build conceptual entity relationship models.

### [Week 2](./Week%202): Relational Models

>Introduce the concepts about relational models. Train students with how to convert a conceptual entity relationship model to a relational model.

### [Week 3](./Week%203): Normalization

>Introduce students with the reasons and process of normalization. Train students with skills to normalize a relational model to 3NF.

### [Week 4](./Week%204): Case Study

>A summary of the knowledge we learned in this course, starting from an Entity Relationship Model to a Relational Model in 3NF and ready for implementation.

## Remarks
- The course teaches PostgreSQL.
- The lecturer was really careful to make the course as user friendly as possible. 
  - video lectures are easy to follow 
  - slides are shared
  - there are plenty of practice exercises called labs, that are easy to complete on the grounds of the lectures
  - the lecturer set up a [bit.io](https://bit.io/) database for the course. Most of the lab exercises are done on [this](https://bit.io/alanparadise/nw) database. For the final lab there is a [new](https://bit.io/alanparadise/cm) database, and for those labs that do not work on the lecturer's database detailed instructions are given about how the student can to set up and use her/his own database.

## Course description

>"This course is designed for learners with limited coding experience, providing a solid foundation of not just Java, but core Computer Science topics that can be transferred to other languages. The modules in this course cover functions, recursion, objects, and mutability. Completion of the prior 2 courses in this specialization are recommended.
>
>To allow for a truly hands-on, self-paced learning experience, this course is video-free. Assignments contain short explanations with images and runnable code examples with suggested edits to explore code examples further, building a deeper understanding by doing. You'll benefit from instant feedback from a variety of assessment items along the way, gently progressing from quick understanding checks (multiple choice, fill in the blank, and un-scrambling code blocks) to small, approachable coding exercises that take minutes instead of hours."

[^1]: For ethical reasons I do not make my code for the final coding exercises publicly available. It is strictly against [Coursera Honor Code](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code?language=en_US). However, I share the source code of the coding practice challenges. These are right before the final coding exercises, and check roughly the same knowledge that is checked in the final coding exercises.

# Week 4 <br> Mutability

## Learning Objectives
- Define the term mutable
- Construct a function to modify instance variables (attributes)
- Define the term Instance method
- Convert an external method that modifies an object into an instance method
- Demonstrate the syntax for calling a method
- Define the term static method
- Identify when using a static method makes sense
- Demonstrate the syntax for calling an instance method
- Differentiate method scope between instance methods and static methods

## [Coding practice challenge](./LabChallenge.java)

>"You are going to develop a method that takes an ArrayList of strings as a parameter, iterates through that ArrayList and greets every element in it with `"Hello"` followed by a newline.
>
>Requirements:
>- You should not make any changes to the code that already exists. If you accidentally delete any existing code, you can copy and paste the entire program from above.
>- You can use any number of additional methods youâ€™d like but you must include at least the method called `sayHello()` in your code."

# Week 2 <br> Recursion

## Learning Objectives
- Define recursion
- Identify the base case
- Identify the recursive pattern

## [Coding practice challenge](./LabChallenge.java)

>"Write a recursive method called `recursivePower` that takes two integers[^remark] as parameters. The first parameter is the base and the second parameter is the exponent. Return the base parameter to the power of the exponent."

[^remark]:Although the challenge mentions "integers as parameters", the code I share only handles the cases where the exponent is non-negative (as well as the official solution of codio).

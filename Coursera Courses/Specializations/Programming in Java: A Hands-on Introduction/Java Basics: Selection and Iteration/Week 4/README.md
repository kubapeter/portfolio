# Week 4 <br> Loops

## Learning Objectives
- Explain for loop syntax
- Identify the causes of an infinite loop
- Identify the relationship between patterns, loops, and output
- Explain while loop syntax
- Identify the causes of an infinite while loop
- Describe the break statement as it relates to a while loop
- Explain nested loop syntax
- Identify the relationship between the variables in each loop with the output produced

## [Coding practice challenge](./Lab_Challenge.java)

>"Assignment:
>
>For this challenge, you will use your knowledge of patterns, conditionals, and nested `for` loops to produce the following output:
```
XOXOXOXOX
OXO
OXO
XOXOXOXOX
OXO
OXO
XOXOXOXOX
OXO
OXO
```
>Requirement:
>
>Your program must include at least two `for` loops, one nested within another, in order to receive credit. In addition, you are only allowed to use, at most, two `System.out.print()` or `System.out.println()` statements."

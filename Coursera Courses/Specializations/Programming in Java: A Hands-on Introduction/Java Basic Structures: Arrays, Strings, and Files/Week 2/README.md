## [Coding practice challenge](./LabChallenge.java)

>"You are going to write a program that takes a string called `myString` and returns the string but with a `*` in the place of vowels. Assume that vowels are upper and lowercase `a, e, i, o, u`. For example, if `myString = "Hello"`, then your program will print `"H*ll*"`.

>Requirements:
>
>- You should not make any changes to the code that already exists. If you accidentally delete any existing code, you can copy and paste the entire program from above.
>- You can use any number of string methods and conditionals to produce the desired output.

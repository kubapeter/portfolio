# Week 1 <br> Encapsulation

## Learning Objectives
- Define the term encapsulation
- Differentiate between public and private
- Explain which parts of a class should public, private, or both
- Explain why encapsulation can be beneficial
- Define data validation
- Define the terms getter, setter, and data validation
- Demonstrate how to access private attributes with getters
- Demonstrate how to change private attributes with setters
- Demonstrate validating data with setters

## [Coding practice challenge](./LabChallenge.java)

>"Problem
>
>Write a class named `Person` that has attributes for name, age, and occupation. These attributes should be private. Create getters and setters for each attribute following Java conventions.
>
>Expected Output
>- Declare the instance `new Person("Citra Curie", 16, "student")`
>- The method `getName()` returns `Citra Curie`
>- The method `setName("Rowan Faraday")` changes the name attribute to `“Rowan Faraday”`
>- The method `getAge()` returns 16
>- The method `setAge(18)` changes the age attribute to 18
>- The method `getOccupation()` returns `student`
>- The method `setOccupation("plumber")` changes the occupation attribute to “plumber”"

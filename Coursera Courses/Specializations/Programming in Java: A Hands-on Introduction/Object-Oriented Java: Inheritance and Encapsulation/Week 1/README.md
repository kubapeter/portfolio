# Week 1 <br> Encapsulation

## Learning Objectives
- Define the term encapsulation
- Differentiate between public and private
- Explain which parts of a class should public, private, or both
- Explain why encapsulation can be beneficial
- Define data validation
- Define the terms getter, setter, and data validation
- Demonstrate how to access private attributes with getters
- Demonstrate how to change private attributes with setters
- Demonstrate validating data with setters

## [Coding practice challenge](./LabChallenge.java)

>"You are going to develop a method that takes an ArrayList of strings as a parameter, iterates through that ArrayList and greets every element in it with `"Hello"` followed by a newline.
>
>Requirements:
>- You should not make any changes to the code that already exists. If you accidentally delete any existing code, you can copy and paste the entire program from above.
>- You can use any number of additional methods youâ€™d like but you must include at least the method called `sayHello()` in your code."

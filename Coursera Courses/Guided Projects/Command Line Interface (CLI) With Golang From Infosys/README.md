[^1]: For ethical reasons I do not make my assignments publicly available. It may be tempting to submit them to Coursera by others. However, for every assignment I give a detailed description of the original problem, I highlight the main principles and techniques the problem wants to check, and I give source code for another similar problem. The publicly available source code uses approximately the same principles and techniques as the original (sometimes a bit more).

## Syllabus

#### Module 1: SQL and Table Design

>"In this module, we'll introduce you to the course and discuss which topics we'll cover. We'll also explore why SQL is a powerful tool to use and some of it's uses. Then, we'll explore table design and schemas."
>- List the topics covered in this course
>- Explain why you would use SQL
>- List several uses for SQL
>- Define schema and explain its purpose

#### Module 2: SQL Database Terms ([Demonstrations](./Demonstrations/module2.sql))

>"In this module, we'll explore some of the key terms you'll need to know when building SQL Databases. We will compare and contrast the `ANY` and `ALL` operators, distinguish between `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`, and explore pseudocolumns. We will also give examples for some of these terms."
>- Demonstrate an understanding of the database terms presented
>- Compare and contrast the `ANY` and `ALL` operators
>- Describe the difference between `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`
>- Explain what a pseudocolumn is and its purpose

#### Module 3: Key Constraints and the USING Clause ([Demonstrations](./Demonstrations/module3.sql))

>"In this module, we'll review primary and foreign keys, delving a little more into their constraints. We'll also explore the `USING` clause and what it is used for."
>- Explain how to automatically generate a value in a table
>- List the characteristics of `FOREIGN KEY` Constraints
>- List the primary characteristics of `PRIMARY KEY` Constraints
>- Demonstrate how to define a primary key in your table
>- Describe the `USING` clause, what it does, and how to use it

#### Module 4: Functions, Subqueries, Pseudocolumns, and Views ([Demonstrations](./Demonstrations/module4.sql))

>"In this module, we'll take a look at `INSTRING` and `SUBSTRING` functions and demonstrate naming a column using an alias. We will also explore subqueries and take another look at pseudocolumns. Lastly, we'll discuss views and compare them with materialized views."
>- Explain the `INSTRING` and `SUBSTRING` functions
>- Demonstrate giving a column an alias
>- Define subquery and explain when you may use one
>- Compare and contrast `VIEW`s and `MATERIALIZED VIEW`s
>- Explain what a pseudocolumn is and its purpose

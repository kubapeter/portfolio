Week 3 is about group functions, subTotals, and subqueries
- SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX()
- GROUP BY (partition of table rows)
  - HAVING (similar to WHERE but for group func.-s and with GROUP BY, works on interim table and not the input table)
- SubQueries
  - WHERE \<A\> = SQ, WHERE \<A\> IN SQ 
  - SELECT SQ
  - FROM SQ
- Co-related subquery

# Week 6 <br> Advanced SQL Commands

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the `VIEW` and demonstrate ability to create and use a `VIEW`
- Demonstrate ability to add conditionals to SQL using the `CASE` expression
- Show how to Combine answers using the `UNION`
- Understand how to create primary keys with `IDENTITY`

## Labs

There are 2 labs for week 2. These labs are done on the student's own database in the [bit.io](https://bit.io/) environment, as students do not have permission to add or modify database objects of the lecturer's repo.
- [Using a VIEW](./lab11.sql)
- [Conditionals with the CASE Operator](./lab12.sql)

There is also a [Final Lab](../Final%20Lab) on a [database](https://bit.io/alanparadise/cm) not used so far.

Week 4 is about JOINs
- primary key, common key, foreign key
- Inner Join (implicit, explicit)
- Three-Way Join
- Join as meaningful rows (ON \<A\> = \<B\>) of the Cartesian Product
  - in implicit JOIN without WHERE SQL returns the whole Cartesian Product
- Outer Join
  - Left Outer Join
  - Right Outer Join

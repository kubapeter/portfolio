# Week 4 <br> Getting Data from Multiple Tables

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to retrieve data from multiple tables using the `JOIN`
- Demonstrate awareness of the risks of the Cartesian Product
- Describe the `LEFT` and `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` and demonstrate when and how to use them

## Subjects covered
- primary key, common key, foreign key
- Inner Join (implicit, explicit)
- Three-Way Join
- Join as meaningful rows (`ON <A> = <B>`) of the Cartesian Product
  - in implicit `JOIN` without `WHERE` SQL returns the whole Cartesian Product
- Outer Join
  - Left Outer Join
  - Right Outer Join

## Labs

There are 2 labs for week 2
- [Inner JOINS](./lab6.sql)
- [Outer JOINS](./lab7.sql)

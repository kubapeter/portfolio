[^1]: For ethical reasons I do not make my assignments publicly available. It may be tempting to submit them to Coursera by others. However, for every assignment I give a detailed description of the original problem, I highlight the main principles and techniques the problem wants to check, and I give source code for another similar problem. The publicly available source code uses approximately the same principles and techniques as the original (sometimes a bit more). 

This course discusses common foundational principles and practices used by agile methodologies, providing you with a flexible set of tools to use in your role (e.g. product owner, scrum master, project manager, team member) on an agile team. Learn agile and lean principles, including kanban and scrum, and use Jira Software Cloud as the tool to apply hands-on exercises in these topics. The course includes instruction on company-managed and team-managed Jira projects. 

After completing this course, you will have a strong foundational understanding of agile principles and practices and hands-on experience with Jira Software Cloud. Site administrators will be able to perform basic administration tasks. You will be able to continuously configure your Jira projects to match your team's custom agile methodology.

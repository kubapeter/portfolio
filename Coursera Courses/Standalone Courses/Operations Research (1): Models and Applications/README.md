## Content
This folder contains 
- [x] [slides](./Slides) 
- [x] [Excel sheets](./Excel%20sheets) of the algoritms (and pdf notes on them)
- [x] [certificate](./Coursera_Certificate_Operations_Research_(1)_Models_and_Applications.pdf) ([verification](https://coursera.org/verify/LCPVP2SSPK3X))

## Remarks
- The course is really fun. The lecturer is thorough, shares the slides, so it is easy to follow the well structured lectures. 
- For some practical calculations the course intorduces and uses Excel spreadsheets. 
- Athough not part of a Coursera specialization, the course has its sister-courses 
[Operations Research (2): Optimization Algorithms](../Operations%20Research%20(2):%20Optimization%20Algorithms) and 
[Operations Research (3): Theory](../Operations%20Research%20(3):%20Theory).

## Syllabus

### Week 1: **Course Overview**
>"This lecture gives students an overview of what they may expect from this course, including the fundamental concept and brief history of Operations Research. We will also talk about how mathematical programming can be used to solve real-world business problem.
>- After this lecture, students will get a concrete idea about this course."

### Week 2: **Linear Programming** 
>"Linear programming (LP) is one of the most important method to achieve the outcome of optimization problems. We can use LP models for various decisions, including production, inventory, personnel scheduling, etc.
>- Students will learn the basic elements of a linear program, how to formulate linear programs, how to solve a two-variate linear program with the graphical approach, and how to solve a general linear program with Microsoft Excel."

### Week 3: **Integer Programming**
>"In many practical areas, some of the optimization problems occur with integrality constraints imposed on some of the variables. Facility location, machine scheduling, and vehicle routing are some examples. Integer Programming (IP) provides a mathematical way to solve these problems. 
>- Students will learn how to formulate integer programs, see various applications, and learn how to use Microsoft Excel to solve a general integer program."

### Week 4: **Nonlinear programming**
>"In the real life, many problems involve nonlinearities. Examples include pricing, inventory, and portfolio optimization. For such problems, we may use Nonlinear Programming (NLP) to formulate them into models and solve them. 
>- Students will learn how to formulate nonlinear programs, see various applications, and learn how to use Microsoft Excel to solve a general nonlinear program."

### Week 5: **Case Study: Personnel Scheduling**
>"In this lecture, we introduce a real business case that has been solved with Operations Research by the instructor. The problem is for a company to schedule its customer service representatives to minimize the total amount of staff shortage. We will demonstrate the problem, process of conducting an OR study, integer programming formulation, and result.
>- Students will see a real case being solved by Operations Research and obtain more ideas about the way to conducting an OR study."

### Week 6: **Course Summary and Future Directions**
>"In the final lecture of this course, we will summarize what we have learned. We will also preview what we may learn in future courses.
>- Students will get a wrap up for this course and an idea about further studies."

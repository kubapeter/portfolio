## [Slides](./Slides/README.md)

## [Codes](./Codes)

In the coding sessions the lecturer shows
- how to create the same [simple app](../Module%202/Codes/Simple%20Node%20App) of the end of the previous module, but this time [using Express](./Codes/Simple%20Express%20Application)
- generating and Express app using Handlebars template
- restructuring the generated app according to MVC model

All these smaller steps lead to a final [simple Node.js application](./Codes/Simple%20Node%20App).

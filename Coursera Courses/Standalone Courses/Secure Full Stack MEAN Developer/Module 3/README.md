## [Slides](./Slides/README.md)

## [Codes](./Codes)

In the coding sessions the lecturer shows
- the asynchronous nature of the [I/O cycle](./Codes/IO%20Cycle/iocycle.js)
- how modules [export and import](./Codes/Modules)
- the creation of an [HTTP webserver](./Codes/Creating%20HTTP%20Webserver/app.js)
- how an HTTP webserver [responds to requests](./Codes/Responding%20to%20HTTP%20Requests)
- how [rounting](./Codes/Routing/app.js) is made 

All these smaller steps lead to a final [simple Node.js application](./Codes/Simple%20Node%20App).
